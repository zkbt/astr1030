# Estimates for the Circumference of the Earth

The plot below collects all the measurements we've made of Earth's circumference so far during the Fall 2020 semester of ASTR1030. Can you find your estimates on here? What do you notice about estimates made with different numbers of steps? How does the average of these estimates compare to the true value of Earth's circumference (4x10^7 m)?
